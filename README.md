# Banff Traffic Management Project

## Project Overview
This is a collaborative project applying data analytics and machine learning techniques to study traffic and parking patterns in Banff. The goal is to provide insights that can help improve traffic flow, parking efficiency, and resource planning.

## Repository Structure
- Notebooks/ – Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling.
- data/ – CSV files for analysis (not tracked in Git).
- .gitignore – Specifies files and folders to exclude from version control.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on traffic and parking datasets.
- Predictive modeling using machine learning to identify trends and optimize parking management.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing pipelines for reproducible analysis.

## Notes
- CSV data files are not included in the repository for privacy and size reasons.
- Make sure to follow the .gitignore rules to avoid uploading large or sensitive files.
